        Maulana Bhasani announced the establishment of the university at the
        Kagmari conference on 8 February 1957, but organizational activities did
        not start until 1970. Despite his efforts, the Islamic University was
        not implemented during his lifetime. In 1982, a government initiative
        led to the formation of a committee to establish a university based on
        Bhasani's vision. However, due to political instability, progress
        stalled. In 1996, the government aimed to expand science and technology
        education in remote areas, and in 1997, with ADB support, plans were
        made to establish a science and technology university in Tangail. The
        foundation stone of Maulana Bhasani Science and Technology University
        (MBSTU) was laid by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in 1999. The university
        began classes on 25 October 2003 with two departments: Computer Science
        and Engineering (CSE) and Information and Communication Technology

        Administration. Between 2013 and 2015, the university faced significant
        unrest, including violence and vandalism, leading to a temporary closure
        in 2015 after the murder of a student leader.
